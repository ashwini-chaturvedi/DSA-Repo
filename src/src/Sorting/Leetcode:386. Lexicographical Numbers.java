/* Approach:
as we know we want to get the sorted list of numbers less than the given numbers in lexicographical order.

what do you mean by lexicographical here ??

i mean if lets say n = 11 then sorted numbers would be =>
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 , 11}

but if i ask you that convert them in form of string and then sort it...then it would be like below :-
{1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

so we need to sort them in this way.

ok then how to generate them ?

well so as you would have observed , we started with 1 and then all its associated values like

1---> (1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ....and so one)

but we need to take care that our number should not go greater than the n while generating those series..

on so what is next ?

next is we have to generate to other numbers as well
like below =>
2 -->{2, 20, 21, 22, 23 ...so on }
3---> {3, 30, 31, 32, 33, ...so on}
.
.
.
** till we get equal to num...and thats it.**

but string sorting takes O(n log n) , how would make it better?

i am not using any sorting algorithm, i would do some jugaad.

what is jugaad??

i mean some logic we would make so that things would be sorted without using built in methods and in O(n).

ok so tell me that logical jugaad?

lets take n = 25 , lets say i have a list initially empty.
int curr = 1;

for i=1 to i<=25 i++
// would add curr
{1, }
//now i have to add association of 1 , 10, 11 .....>
so to do that we have to multiply curr with 10 (curr=1 as of now)

curr = 1*10; 10 so its less than 25 so no problem, will go to loop

now we would add curr to list (curr = 10 now), now list like below

{1, 10, }

again we will multiply curr * 10 = 10 * 10 = 100 But But this is greater than 25 .

yes so we can not do that ....then what ?

no problem whenever this situation appear we will go to else part and increment the curr by 1

well so now curr = 10 + 1 = 11 ...will go to for loop again...
now our list would look like :-

{1, 10, 11}

again curr*10 = 110 greater than 25...so again go to else part and keep on increatment them.

our list would be at times like below :-
{1, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19} at this time our char = 19 and we would going below ...again curr = 10 * 19 = 190 > 25 so again will go to else part

BUT BUT bro your were saying we would keep on creament curr by one so now you would make it curr = 19 + 1 = 20

so you would add 20 to list , so where is 2 ? why why??

wait a min i would be also checking in else part that whatever is my curr value does this curr is having curr % 10 = 9

with this help i will catch the values like 19, so when curr = 19
in else part if(curr%10==9) i will update the curr val so that it will converted to

curr = curr/10 ===> 19/10 ==> 1
and now again i will increase it so curr = curr + 1 = 2

and yes , i would keep on doing same thing.

but wait a min, how would you print all those single digits like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ?

well when we would add the numbers till 25 , our curr = 26 , we will again come curr = curr*26 > 25 , so we will go to else part....

now here i would also add a condition same if where we put curr%10==9
i will use OR curr>=n (25 in this case) we will make

curr = curr/10; ===> 25/10 ===> 2 increment = 2+1 = 3 will go to for loop again ..... curr = 10*3 > 25, will go to else part, will increase it again ....

it would add 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

Ok, so what is next value after adding 9?

ohh, come one bro, our for loop is only runs 25 times...it would be done no more execcution.

our list would be like this:-
{1, 10, ....19, 2, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
