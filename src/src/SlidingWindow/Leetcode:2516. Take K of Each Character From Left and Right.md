            counter[s.charAt(j)-'a']--;//as we get the element its counter will decrease because then it will be in not tobe deleted window

            // If any count falls below `k`, shrink the window from the left
            while(i<=j && !isValid(counter,k)){//
                counter[s.charAt(i)-'a']++;//removing from not to be deleted window then it can be deleted so increasing its counter.

            notDeletedWindowSize=Math.max(notDeletedWindowSize,j-i+1);//maximise the notTobedeleted window size so as to get minimum sized to be deleted string following the condition given in question

        return s.length()-notDeletedWindowSize;//total length minus not to be deleted gives to be deleted window size...
