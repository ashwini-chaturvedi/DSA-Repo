# How to Find 1's Complement
- Convert the number to its binary representation.
- Flip all the Bits in Num
- e.g:2's Complement of 0010 is 1101
- Example 1:


    Representing -5 in 8-bit 1's Complement:

    Binary of 5 in 8 bits: 00000101.

    Flip all bits to get 1's complement: 11111010.

- Example 2:


    Representing +5 in 8-bit 1's Complement:

    Binary of 5 in 8 bits: 00000101 (unchanged since it's positive).

# How to Find 2's Complement
- Convert the number to its binary representation.
- Find 1's Complement(Flip all the Bits)
- Add 1 to it
- Example:
  

    Representing -5 in 8-bit 2's Complement

    Binary of 5 in 8 bits: 00000101.

    Find the 1's complement: 11111010 (flip all bits).

    Add 1: 11111010 + 1 = 11111011.

    Thus, the 8-bit 2's complement of -5 is 11111011.
