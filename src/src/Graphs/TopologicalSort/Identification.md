Key Characteristics of Topological Sort Problems:
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):

The problem explicitly states or implies that the input is a directed graph and acyclic.
If there's a possibility of cycles, the problem may ask you to detect and handle them (e.g., "check if the graph is a DAG").
Dependency Relationships:

Tasks or nodes have dependencies, meaning one task/node must occur before another. For example:
"Task A must be completed before Task B."
"Node X must appear before Node Y."
These dependencies naturally form a directed edge in a graph.
Ordering Requirement:

The problem asks for an order of execution or processing that respects all dependencies. For example:
"Find the order of tasks."
"Determine a valid sequence of steps."
"Arrange nodes so that dependencies are resolved."
Graph Representation:

Input is given as:
Edges: A list of directed edges like (A → B), implying A must come before B.
Adjacency List/Matrix: A graph representation of nodes and their dependencies.
Problems may also provide tasks or courses in plain text, requiring you to model them as a graph first.
Common Problem Types Involving Topological Sort:
Task Scheduling:

Example: "Given tasks with prerequisites, find a valid task execution order."
Hint: Words like "prerequisites," "order," "tasks," or "schedule" signal this type of problem.
Course Ordering:

Example: "Can you finish all courses given course prerequisites?"
Hint: Phrases like "complete all courses," "valid order," or "prerequisite graph" are clues.
Dependency Resolution:

Example: "Find the order of building a project given dependencies between components."
Hint: Words like "dependency graph," "build order," or "execution sequence."
Cycle Detection in Directed Graphs:

Example: "Is it possible to schedule all tasks?" (May involve finding a topological order or detecting cycles.)
Hint: Look for tasks, prerequisites, or nodes without a feasible order.
Common Questions and Scenarios:
Determine Feasibility:

If the problem asks whether tasks can be completed, it's likely testing for cycle detection in a DAG.
Use Kahn’s Algorithm or DFS to check if a topological order is possible.
Generate a Valid Order:

If the problem asks for a specific valid sequence, it involves topological sorting.
Use either:
Kahn's Algorithm (BFS-based) for a level-by-level approach.
DFS with a stack for reverse post-order traversal.
Multiple Valid Orders:

If the problem mentions multiple possible orders, find one of them using any standard topological sorting method.
